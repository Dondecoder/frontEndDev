.every pretty much returns a boolean value of turue or false if all numbers in the array meet the condition that is set, for example
    lines 1 - 3 show that if all exam scores in the array are higher than 75 then the value returned will be true. If even one exam 
    score was less then 75 the boolean value would be false

.some returns a boolean value if even one of the values in the array meet the condition. For example in lines 5 -54. The condition 
    is asking if any movie year is greater than 2015. Since not one movie year is greater than 2015 it would return false. If one movie
    year was greater than 2015 then the value would be changed to true. Consult the mdn docs for more info
