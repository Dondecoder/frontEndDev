Arrow Function With adding in the arrow shortcut it eliminates the need to write the word function in your code make your code more 
    condensed. For ex lines 1 -7. lines 1 - 3 are how we were taught usually to run a function. With the new arrow function it makes assigning a function 
    easier. For example const birthDay = function (days) {return days} that's how we'd usually write a function with arrow it allows us to
    write const birthDay = (days) => {return days}. It will give you the same output it just shortens the code. When you assign a variable
    with a function that has nothing to pass you still need to put parenthesis to activate the arrow function please see lines 16 -22. Even
    if the function has no paramaters you still need to put the open and close parenthesis as if you were running the function. If you only
    have one paramater the open or close parenthesis isn't really even needed but it's better that you use it. For reference see example you
    did from lines 24-26

Implicit returns allows us to use arrow functions without the need to use the return option to return the output to the variable. *Very
    important to know that these only workon codes that are one liners meaning there's only one line of code (which is typically the return
    function) after you define the function.* Please refer to lines 20 -22. The big difference here is that in order to eliminate the 
    return function you need to use parenthesis around the single line of code for example: const num = (num) => (Math.floor(Math.pow(
    num, 2 )));. It eliminates the need for return function inside the curly braces.

Adding Arrow functions and implicit returns with map functions
    You can use arrow functions and implicit returns with map functions as well. Please see line 54 - 57.
