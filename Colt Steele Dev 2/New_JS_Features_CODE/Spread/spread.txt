Spread
  Spread syntax allows an iterable such as an array to be expanded in places where zero or more arguments (for function calls) or elements (for array literals) are expected, 
  ora an object expression to be expanded in places where zero or more key-value pairs (for object literals) are expected. Sread allows us to access each individual items in
  an array. For example please see line 1 - 4. You use elipsis to represent the spread fucntion.
  
  Array literal
    This allows us to use the spread function in arrays with string data in them. Also to call that information as well. Please see lines 7 -14, Thank You. 
    
    
   Spread in Object Literals
    Copies properties from one object into another object literal.
