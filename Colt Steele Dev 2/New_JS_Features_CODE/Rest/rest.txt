Rest Param
  Collects all remaining arguments into an actual array
  This paramater uses 3 dots like the spread method except that it can be used to convert a paramater into an array. Please see lines 6 -14. The argument method doesn't work
  with arrow functions and some array functions. When using the rest param it allows you to convert inputs to arrays without needing to put the actual array. 
The arguments object 
  is available inside every function. It's an array-like object that has a length property and does not have array methods like push/pop.
  this method contains alll the arguments passed to the fuction. Also it is not avaialable inside of arrow functions.
