Function Scope based on where a variable is defined will determine the output of the equations. For example lines 61 - 64 you use the
same variable name to define two different variable. One of the variable is inside ths cope of the function and the other is a global
variable. When you call the function the variable assignment inside the function will run first but if not typically the global function 
would usually run first.If you define a variable inside the function it is scoped to that function

Block scope includes contional and loops typically what's inside the curly braces. Instead of dealing with a function they are 
defined in that block between the curly braces. In this case we are talking about conditionals and loops. Please refer 
to line 68 - 73

Lexical Scoping this means if we have some outerscoping and some inner function defined in it. In order to use the function that you 
created you need call the inner function that is  nested inside the parent function. Please see line 75 - 82. An inner function has 
access to the same function as it's parent.
