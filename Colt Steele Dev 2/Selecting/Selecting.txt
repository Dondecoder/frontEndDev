  getElementByld
    The Document method getElementById() returns an Element object representing the element whose id property matches the specified string. 
    Since element IDs are required to be unique if specified, they're a useful way to get access to a specific element quickly.
    Please refer to the mdn docs for more info: https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document/getElementById
