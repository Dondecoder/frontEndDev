setTimeout allows you set an interval of time for your code to work for example see lines 1 -6. You can tell your code to wait a certain
    amout of seconds before executing another part of your code. 

setInterval allows you do pretty much the same thing as setTimeout except it will run continously unless you use clearInterval. Please 
see line 9 -13.
