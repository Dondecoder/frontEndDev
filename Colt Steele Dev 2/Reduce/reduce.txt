Reduce
  this excutes a reducer function on each element of the array, resulting in a single value. 
  reduce allows you to do multiple functions such as adding elements in an array, choosing min value, or even assigning an initial value to the array. See lines 1 -20 on how
  reduce can be use to assign a min value and to add the function in the array. Reduce needs two paramaters with one to choose the array and the next to choose every element 
  of that array. You then write a function stating what you want the reduce method to do. As in add up funds, return a value, multiply etc. Please refer to reduce doc and section 
  22 lecture 229.
