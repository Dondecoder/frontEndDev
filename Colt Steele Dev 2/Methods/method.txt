Method is a function that has been placed as a property on an object. If we access a function by putting a dot infornt of its name it's
a method but it's also a function 
    You can also use a short hand to define your functions within an object. You don't need to include the function keyword you can
    leave it off when defining the function inside the object. Please refer to line 1 - 9. Please refer to exercise you completer from
    line 11 - 19. 

As in (this) method allows you to refer to an key within you object by using this. For example line 21 -28 allows you to use this to refer to 
the name element in the cat object. You can use this for name, color, breed etc in this example. To call the function of meow. You would
write cat.meow(). A main thing to remember with this is that it changes when applied to a function assigned to a variable. The value of 
this depends on the invocation context of the function it is used in. For example in line 30 you use meow2 to capture the function of 
cat.meow but it will not execute the same way cat.meow does because the this method will be reassigned to pull from the window method of
meow2 rather than the cat method. To make more sense of it every function is usually assigned to the windows method. if you were to type
in windows() it will have a whole lot of functions. when ever you assign a function it is added to the windows method. due to the fact 
that meow2 does not have anything in front of it when the function is called the this method defaults to refering to windows rather than 
the cat object. If confused review section 21 lecture 217.
