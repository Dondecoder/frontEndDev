Functions are a two step process where we define the function and then run it. 
    When writing function you should use function then the function name then parenthesis then curly braces. 
    to run a function you have to call the function kind of like Python. You would put function name then parenthesis.
    Line 42 -52:
        Defines the function and calls the function to run it.  

Function arguments 
    When passing a function argument you need to define the argument in the parenthesis of the function. Refer to lines 54 -48. 
    When you call the function input the paramater as it's defined type. For example Jack is a string so call greet ('Jack'). It will say
    Hi I'm Jack. If you input a number no need to make it a string. 

Multiple Function arguments
    When passing a mutliple function argument you need to define the multiple arguments. Refer to line 60 -66. The function has two 
    paramaters str, numTimes. We define the result variable and use a for loop to loop the results. Then we print out the results using
    console.log. It will print the results however amount of times that you input into numTimes. 

Return statement ends function execution and specifies the value to be returned by that function. 
    Line 68 -73 explains that if the type
    of x variable is not a number or the type of y variable is not a number then the value that is returned back to the equation is false.
    If it is a number then it will return the value of x + y. The return value doesn't just output the result of the equation like the print
    funtion instead it takes the value and allows it to be usable within the equation. Ex if you wanted to categorize the results of x + y in 
    a variable you can do so with the return function you can say let totalNumber = return x + y. It would store the function in the variable
    for further use.
